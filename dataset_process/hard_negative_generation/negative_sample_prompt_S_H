You will act as an assistant to help me generate a hard negative sample for a user.
Hard negative samples that are very similar to the user's historical preferences or interaction records
but are actually not of interest to the user or do not meet the user's needs.
Below are the instructions:
1. User information will be described in JSON format, containing the following attributes:
{
   "user_id": "The user's ID information",
   "user_profile": "A description of what types of users would like this product"
}
2. The information about interacted products will be described in JSON format, containing the following attributes:
{
   "item_id": "The item's ID information",
   "title": "The item name",
   "item_profile": "A summarization of what types of users would enjoy this product"
}

3. The information I will provide to you:
USER INFORMATION: A JSON string describing the basic information about the user.
INTERACTED PRODUCT: A JSON string describing the basic information about the product.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "hard_negative_item": "The name of the generated negative sampleï¼Œ"
    (Hard negative samples that are very similar to the user's historical preferences or
    interaction records but are actually not of interest to the user or do not meet the user's needs, if unable to generate,
     set this value to "None"),
    "reasoning": "Briefly explain your reasoning for the generation result"
}
2. Ensure that the "hard_negative_item" is no longer than 20 words.
3. The "reasoning" has no word limit.
4. Do not provide any text outside the JSON string.
